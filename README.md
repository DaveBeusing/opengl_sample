Download GLFW
https://www.glfw.org/download.html
https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases/download/3.3.8/glfw-3.3.8.bin.WIN64.zip

If you want to rebuild the project structure, download GLAD as well as GLFW and unzip it into a folder called /include.
Put libglfw3dll.a into a folder called /lib, glad.c into /src and glfw3.dll into the project root or the folder where your executable will be built.

Check out .vscode/tasks.json for compiler arguments.
